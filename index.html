        <p>
            This paper introduces a conceptual design for a high-speed hypersonic aircraft, with a primary focus on the Aurora SR-91, colloquially known as 'the plane that doesn't exist.'
            The aircraft purportedly utilizes a Pulse Wave Detonation engine, renowned for its efficiency in exceeding speeds greater than Mach 5-6. The potential applications of hypersonic flight 
            range from rapid global transportation to enhanced military capabilities, making it a field of intense interest and exploration.
            This paper delves into the specifics of the SR-91's propulsion system, emphasizing its pivotal role in achieving hypersonic flight by examining key factors such as flow behavior and impulse
            and explaining them in terms of the Ideal-Detonation Theory.
        </p>

        <h5 id="Introduction" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>

        <p> Aircraft design is a distinct discipline within aerospace engineering, standing alone amid counterparts like aerodynamics, materials, controls, and propulsion. 
            Traditional engines, predominantly relying on deflagration combustion, encounter limitations when attempting to achieve hypersonic speeds. 
            One major obstacle is the inefficiency of deflagration, where the combustion process occurs at subsonic velocities. 
            This characteristic results in comparatively lower pressure and temperature gradients, making it challenging to propel an aircraft to the extreme speeds.
            Additionally, traditional engines struggle with the management of shockwaves and thermal stresses generated at higher speeds,
            posing significant engineering challenges that can compromise the structural integrity and overall performance of the aircraft.
            <td><a href="#reference-section">(Zihao, X., 2023)</a></td>
        
            Therefore, the need for innovative propulsion systems, 
            such as Pulse Wave Detonation Engines, arises to overcome these limitations.
            PWDEs leverage detonation combustion, a more efficient process, to generate higher pressure and temperature gradients,
            enabling aircraft like the Aurora SR-91 to achieve and sustain hypersonic speeds.
        </p>
        
        <h6 id="AnalysisAndDiscussion" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Pulse Wave Detonation Engine</strong></h6>

        <p>
            A Pulse Wave Detonation Engine is a propulsion technology aiming for efficient and controlled detonation combustion, enhancing engine performance through distinct phases of compression, 
            detonation, and expansion. In the compression phase, shockwave-based compression sets the foundation for the subsequent detonation. During this phase, 
            the fuel and oxidizer mixture undergoes a transition from deflagration to detonation, inducing a shockwave that markedly elevates pressure and temperature. 
            Following the compression, the detonation phase is characterized by a rapid and efficient combustion process, generating a shockwave that significantly intensifies pressure and temperature.
            The concluding expansion phase is pivotal, converting the high-pressure gases into mechanical work.

            Now, delving into the physics governing PWDE, Newton's third law of motion. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
            The expanding combustion wave exerts force on the piston during the action phase, met by an equal and opposite force exerted by the piston on the 
            high-pressure gases during the reaction phase. This reciprocating force propels the piston, converting high-pressure gases into mechanical work. 
            As these gases expand and perform mechanical work, a decrease in pressure ensues, in accordance with the ideal gas law. This expansion results in an increase in volume, 
            liberating kinetic energy that significantly contributes to the overall propulsion of the engine. 
            The culmination of these processes ensures a high thrust-to-weight ratio, a critical factor in sustaining supersonic flight.

        <h7 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Ideal-Detonation Theory</strong></h7>
        <p>
            In the Zeldovich–von Neumann–Doering (ZND) model, the reciprocal relationship ρu = constant signifies a dynamic interplay between velocity and density 
            as the detonation wave progresses through the reaction zone. This relationship has profound implications for thrust generation in PWDEs.
            The initiation of a steady ZND detonation involves an incoming unburnt reactant mixture (D) moving at the supersonic shock velocity, fig 1.1. As this mixture encounters the inviscid shock, 
            pressure undergoes a discontinuous increase to its maximum value, driven by shock compression. Simultaneously, the velocity behind the shock wave transitions from supersonic to subsonic values. 
            The pressure then gradually decreases to its equilibrium state due to flow expansion through the reaction zone, marking the initial phase of the detonation process.
            "The temperature within the combustion chamber experiences a twofold change during this phase. Firstly, there's an immediate increase due to shock compression. 
            Subsequently, as the reaction progresses through the reaction zone, temperature continues to rise owing to the heat release associated with the reaction".
            <td><a href="#reference-section">(Nakamura.t, 2010)</a></td>
        </p>

        <p>
         The increase in subsonic velocity, governed by the ZND model's depiction of the detonation process, translates into a corresponding increase in thrust.
         As the detonation wave progresses, the high-pressure gases expand, and the force exerted on the engine components is amplified. 
         This force, resulting from the reciprocal relationship between velocity and density, propels the aircraft forward, providing the necessary thrust for propulsion.

        <h8 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Flow Behavior: Impulse</strong></h8>
        
          <p>
              The impulse generation in a Pulse Wave Detonation Engine is intricately linked to the engine's cyclical process. As the detonation wave progresses through the chamber, 
              the sudden increase in pressure initiates a dynamic interplay within the ZND detonation process, giving rise to impulse. In accordance with the x–t diagram depicted in 
              Fig. 1.4(b),
              the exhausting rarefaction accelerates the high-pressure burned products out of the chamber. This process results in a sonic flow condition at the exit plane of the PWDE.
              Concurrently, when the exhausting rarefaction wave reaches and reflects from the head end of the chamber, the pressure on the thrust wall gradually decreases towards ambient conditions. 
              This dual-action of rarefaction and reflection contributes to the force exerted on the engine components, propelling the aircraft forward.
