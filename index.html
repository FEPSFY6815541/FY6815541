            Hypersonic Propulsion with Detonation Engines</h3>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>

        <p>
            The paper presents a conceptual design for a high-speed hypersonic aircraft, with a primary focus on the Aurora SR-91, often known as 'the plane that doesn't exist'. 
            This aircraft supposedly uses a Pulse Wave Detonation engine which in turn is more effecient in reaching hyper sonic speeds.
            The key principle behind a PWDE is the use of detonation, which is a much more efficient form of combustion than the deflagration typically seen in traditional engines. 
            Detonation combustion produces higher pressure and temperature gradients, which can lead to improved engine efficiency and power output.</p>

        <p>This paper delves into the specifics of the SR-91's propulsion system, emphasizing its role in the capability of hypersonic flight by also looking at key factors; flow behaviour and 
            impulse. Of particular interest is the propulsion system, 
            a component that significantly impacts aircraft performance. By combining the flow behavior and impulse, in the propulsion system,
            two important parameters, it represents the cumulative effect of force applied over time can be calculated. Unfortunately, 
            this data is not available for the Aurora SR-91, as this is a highly classified aircraft. 
        </p>

        <h5 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>

        <p> Aircraft design is a unique discipline of aerospace engineering. It stands alone in comparison to its counter parts such as aerodynamics, materials, controls and propulsion.
             Aurora : could fly up to 135,000 ft, cruise at mach 5-6 which is considered hypersonic. To describe the PWDE, we will be using a theoretical model to help simplify it.
            The key to understanding the capability of PWDEs in achieving hypersonic speeds lies in the fundamental principles of ideal detonations. While the physical world is inherently 
            three-dimensional and often complex, the ZND (Zeldovich-von Neumann-Doering) ideal-detonation theory provides a valuable and simplified theoretical framework that illuminates the engine's operation.
            This simplification allows for more manageable mathematical analysis and providing insights into impulse generation and 
            core principles underlying the performance of high-speed propulsion systems like Pulse Wave Detonation Engines.
        </p>
        
        <h6 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Pulse Wave Detonation Engine</strong></h6>

        <p>A Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE) is a type of propulsion technology that aims to achieve 
            efficient and controlled detonation combustion for improved engine performance. 
            The operation of a PWDE involves several distinct phases, including compression, detonation, and expansion.
            Here's an overview of how a PWDE operates, including the principles of these phases:</p>
        
        <p>Compression Phase:
            The process begins with the compression phase, similar to conventional engines. 
            Air (or an air-fuel mixture) is drawn into the combustion chamber by the movement of the piston.
            Unlike traditional engines, a PWDE uses shockwave-based compression, where a reflected shockwave from a previous cycle or a separate source compresses the fresh air in the combustion chamber. 
            This creates a highly compressed and pressurized environment, which is crucial for the subsequent detonation phase</p>
        
        <p>Detonation Phase:
            In the detonation phase, the fuel and oxidizer (usually air) mixture is ignited by a spark plug or other ignition source. 
            However, the key difference is that the combustion process transitions from deflagration to detonation.
            In a detonation, the reaction front travels through the mixture at a speed greater than the speed of sound. 
            This rapid combustion generates a shockwave that significantly increases pressure and temperature within the combustion chamber.</p>

        <p>Expansion Phase:
            The expansion phase follows the detonation event.As the combustion wave expands through the combustion chamber, 
            it exerts a tremendous force on the piston. This force causes the piston to move, thereby converting the high-pressure gases into mechanical work.
            This is where the engine's power is produced. The expansion phase is similar to the power stroke in a traditional internal combustion engine, where the expanding gases push the piston.</p>
        
        <p>The unique operational principles of a Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE), with its emphasis on controlled detonation combustion, result in distinct flow behavior within the combustion chamber.
            Understanding this flow behavior is crucial for optimizing engine performance and addressing challenges associated with shockwaves, pressure fluctuations, and heat management.</p>

        
        <h7 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Ideal-Detonation Theory</strong></h7>
        <p>
            In the present study, the mechanism of steady detonation is studied analytically in one dimension via the Zeldovich–von Neumann–Doering (ZND) model.
            The detonation gas is examined in the relative coordinate system, where the origin of the coordinate is at the detonation front shock wave, except for the discussion on friction.
            Primarily, two topics are discussed—the pressure on the detonation tube end and the velocity deficit—using mass, energy, and momentum conservation relations,
            as well as the fact that the velocity of the gas at the end of the rarefaction wave is the same as that of the inflow mixture in the ZND model.
            That is, in the laboratory coordinate system, both the mixture upstream of the detonation and the detonated gas on the tube end wall are at rest
        </p>
        





        <p>Efficiency and Thrust Pulsations: Link the concept of impulse to the efficiency and performance of PWDEs. Explain that the efficient generation of thrust pulsations in a PWDE,
            ideally approaching ZND conditions, contributes to a high impulse over time, which is crucial for the engine's ability to reach and maintain hypersonic speeds.</p>
        <p>By linking the ZND model with the concept of impulse, you can create a coherent narrative that explains how the theoretical framework of ideal detonations relates to the
            practical considerations of achieving hypersonic speeds in PWDEs.
            This connection provides a comprehensive understanding of the engine's efficiency and its capability to reach hypersonic flight</p>
        
        <h8 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Flow Behavior: Impulse</strong></h8>
        
          <p>
              Flow behavior, in the context of a Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE) or any fluid dynamic system, 
            refers to the complex patterns and characteristics of how air or any other fluid flows within that system.
            It encompasses a wide range of factors and phenomena related to the movement of fluids  </p>

TOPIC 1: Flow Behavior: Impulse 

            >Flow behavior encompases various aspects, we will be looking at
            
            THRUST PULSATIONS: have several important implications for flow behavior 
            and the efficiency of PWDEs for hypersonic speeds:
            
            Thrust pulsations are a key characteristic of PWDEs, and they are an essential aspect of the engine's operation.
            In a PWDE, the detonation process is highly dynamic and occurs in cycles. 
            Each detonation cycle results in a rapid and significant increase in pressure, 
            temperature, and thrust, followed by a period of reduced thrust during the exhaust phase.
            this is known as the High Impulse:
        
            The rapid, high-pressure detonation phase generates a high impulse, 
            providing the engine with substantial thrust in a short duration. 
            
            
            >CFD simulations can show how the thrust output varies during the detonation cycle.
            These thrust pulsations, while challenging to manage, can provide efficient propulsion for hypersonic flight.

            Navier-Stokes Equations:
            
            Continuity Equation: 
            The continuity equation ensures that mass is conserved within the flow. It is expressed as:
            ∂ρ/∂t+∇⋅(ρu)=0

            Momentum Equation:
            The momentum equation relates the change in momentum to pressure and viscous forces. It is expressed as:

            ∂(ρu)/∂t+∇⋅(ρuu)=−∇p+∇⋅τ+ρf

            Here, 
            ρ is the fluid density, u is the velocity vector, ∇ is the divergence operator
            p represents pressure, τ is the stress tensor, and f is the body force.

            By solving the Navier-Stokes equations, engineers and researchers can simulate and analyze the flow behavior in a PWDE, 
            which, in turn, aids in optimizing the engine's design and performance. It is worth noting that solving these equations for real-world applications often requires
            the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations due to their complexity. = Can use MATLAB to run these equations.

           >Representing flow behavior in a Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Navier-Stokes equations 
             to show how flow behavior affects the ability of a PWDE to reach hypersonic speeds.

TOPIC 2: Shock Wave Dynamics 

            Mathematical models are used to describe the generation, propagation, and interaction of shock waves in the PWDE. 
            These models often involve partial differential equations (PDEs) to account for variables like pressure, temperature, and velocity.
            The Rankine-Hugoniot equations, which are a set of conservation equations, describe the behavior of shock waves, including the jump conditions across the wave.
            Shock waves and detonation waves can interact in complex ways. Mathematical models, such as the ZND (Zel'dovich-von Neumann-Doering) theory,
            provide insights into wave interaction and how it influences the detonation process.
