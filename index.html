            Hypersonic Propulsion with Detonation Engines</h3>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>

        <p>
            This paper introduces a conceptual design for a high-speed hypersonic aircraft, with a primary focus on the Aurora SR-91, colloquially known as 'the plane that doesn't exist.'
            The aircraft purportedly utilizes a Pulse Wave Detonation engine, renowned for its efficiency in reaching hypersonic speeds. The PWDE operates on the principle of detonation, 
            a significantly more efficient form of combustion compared to the deflagration observed in traditional engines, resulting in higher pressure and temperature gradients.
            This paper delves into the specifics of the SR-91's propulsion system, emphasizing its pivotal role in achieving hypersonic flight by examining key factors such as flow behavior and impulse
            and explaining them in terms of the Ideal-Detonation Theory.
        </p>

        <h5 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>

        <p> Aircraft design is a distinct discipline within aerospace engineering, standing alone amid counterparts like aerodynamics, materials, controls, and propulsion. 
            The Aurora SR-91, with the capability to fly up to 135,000 ft and cruise at Mach 5-6, ventures into the realm of hypersonic flight. 
            To elucidate the Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE), we employ a theoretical model, simplifying the complex principles that underlie its hypersonic capabilities. 
            The Zeldovich-von Neumann-Doering (ZND) ideal-detonation theory provides a valuable and simplified theoretical framework,
            facilitating manageable mathematical analysis and insights into impulse generation, thereby contributing to the understanding of high-speed propulsion systems.
        </p>
        
        <h6 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Pulse Wave Detonation Engine</strong></h6>

        <p>A Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE) is a propulsion technology aiming for efficient and controlled detonation combustion, enhancing engine performance through distinct phases of compression, 
            detonation, and expansion. In the compression phase, the shockwave-based compression sets the stage for subsequent detonation,
            a process where the fuel and oxidizer mixture transitions from deflagration to detonation, generating a shockwave that significantly increases pressure and temperature.
            The expansion phase converts the high-pressure gases into mechanical work, akin to the power stroke in traditional engines. 
            The paper explores the theoretical foundations of PWDEs, emphasizing the ideal-detonation theory's role in understanding rapid and efficient combustion processes characterized by shockwaves.</p>
        
        <p>The unique operational principles of a Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE), with its emphasis on controlled detonation combustion, will be viewed as well from a theoretical point. 
            The ideal-detonation theory often represented by Zeldovich-von Neumann-Doering is a fundamental theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of ideal detonations, 
            which are rapid and efficient combustion processes characterized by shock waves. This theory explains how impulse is generated during the detonation
            phase and how it contributes to propulsion.Understanding this flow behavior is crucial for optimizing engine performance and addressing challenges associated with shockwaves, 
            pressure fluctuations, and heat management.</p>

        
        <h7 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Ideal-Detonation Theory</strong></h7>
        <p>
            In the Zeldovich–von Neumann–Doering (ZND) model, the reciprocal relationship ρu = constant signifies a dynamic interplay between velocity and density as the detonation wave progresses through the reaction zone. 
            This relationship has profound implications for thrust generation in PWDEs.
            The initiation of a steady ZND detonation involves an incoming unburnt reactant mixture moving at the supersonic shock velocity (D) (Reference1). As this mixture encounters the inviscid shock, 
            pressure undergoes a discontinuous increase to its maximum value, driven by shock compression. Simultaneously, the velocity behind the shock wave transitions from supersonic to subsonic values. 
            The pressure then gradually decreases to its equilibrium state due to flow expansion through the reaction zone, marking the initial phase of the detonation process.
            "The temperature within the combustion chamber experiences a twofold change during this phase. Firstly, there's an immediate increase due to shock compression. 
            Subsequently, as the reaction progresses through the reaction zone, temperature continues to rise owing to the heat release associated with the reaction" (Reference1).
            This intricate interplay between shock compression and heat release is precisely captured by the ZND model.
            Within the ZND framework, the subsonic velocity in the reaction zone steadily increases to its equilibrium state (V∞ = UCJ), aligning with the local sonic condition,
            where the velocity of the gas equals the speed of sound.
            This velocity behavior has a reciprocal impact on density, dictated by the one-dimensional nature of the problem and the constancy of mass flux (ρu = constant) (Reference1).
        </p>
        <img src="ZND THEORY.png" alt="Figure 1.1">
        <p>
         The increase in subsonic velocity, governed by the ZND model's depiction of the detonation process, translates into a corresponding increase in thrust.
         As the detonation wave progresses, the high-pressure gases expand, and the force exerted on the engine components is amplified. 
         This force, resulting from the reciprocal relationship between velocity and density, propels the aircraft forward, providing the necessary thrust for propulsion.
         In essence, the reciprocal relationship expressed by ρu = constant within the ZND framework directly influences the thrust generated by PWDE</p>

        <h8 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Flow Behavior: Impulse</strong></h8>
        
          <p>
              Now, linking this back to the broader understanding of impulse generation in PWDEs, the sudden increase in pressure, as described in the ZND model, 
              becomes the driving force behind the generation of impulse. 
              "This impulse, a result of the dynamic interplay within the ZND detonation process, transforms into thrust as the high-pressure gases expand" (Reference1).
              The expansion of these gases exerts force on the engine components, propelling the aircraft forward. Thus, the ZND model, with its detailed depiction of the physics underlying detonation, 
              serves as a foundational guide for optimizing PWDEs to harness the generated impulse effectively, ultimately enhancing efficiency and power output.  </p>

        <h9 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h9>

        <p>
        In summary, within the ZND framework, the interplay between subsonic velocity and density is a manifestation of the conservation laws governing fluid dynamics. The one-dimensional nature of the detonation process,
        as described by the ZND model, allows us to mathematically express these relationships, providing a deeper understanding of the intricate physics at play within Pulse Wave Detonation Engines.</p>

TOPIC 1: Flow Behavior: Impulse 

            >Flow behavior encompases various aspects, we will be looking at
            
            THRUST PULSATIONS: have several important implications for flow behavior 
            and the efficiency of PWDEs for hypersonic speeds:
            
            Thrust pulsations are a key characteristic of PWDEs, and they are an essential aspect of the engine's operation.
            In a PWDE, the detonation process is highly dynamic and occurs in cycles. 
            Each detonation cycle results in a rapid and significant increase in pressure, 
            temperature, and thrust, followed by a period of reduced thrust during the exhaust phase.
            this is known as the High Impulse:
        
            The rapid, high-pressure detonation phase generates a high impulse, 
            providing the engine with substantial thrust in a short duration. 
            
            
            >CFD simulations can show how the thrust output varies during the detonation cycle.
            These thrust pulsations, while challenging to manage, can provide efficient propulsion for hypersonic flight.

            Navier-Stokes Equations:
            
            Continuity Equation: 
            The continuity equation ensures that mass is conserved within the flow. It is expressed as:
            ∂ρ/∂t+∇⋅(ρu)=0

            Momentum Equation:
            The momentum equation relates the change in momentum to pressure and viscous forces. It is expressed as:

            ∂(ρu)/∂t+∇⋅(ρuu)=−∇p+∇⋅τ+ρf

            Here, 
            ρ is the fluid density, u is the velocity vector, ∇ is the divergence operator
            p represents pressure, τ is the stress tensor, and f is the body force.

            By solving the Navier-Stokes equations, engineers and researchers can simulate and analyze the flow behavior in a PWDE, 
            which, in turn, aids in optimizing the engine's design and performance. It is worth noting that solving these equations for real-world applications often requires
            the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations due to their complexity. = Can use MATLAB to run these equations.

           >Representing flow behavior in a Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Navier-Stokes equations 
             to show how flow behavior affects the ability of a PWDE to reach hypersonic speeds.

TOPIC 2: Shock Wave Dynamics 

            Mathematical models are used to describe the generation, propagation, and interaction of shock waves in the PWDE. 
            These models often involve partial differential equations (PDEs) to account for variables like pressure, temperature, and velocity.
            The Rankine-Hugoniot equations, which are a set of conservation equations, describe the behavior of shock waves, including the jump conditions across the wave.
            Shock waves and detonation waves can interact in complex ways. Mathematical models, such as the ZND (Zel'dovich-von Neumann-Doering) theory,
            provide insights into wave interaction and how it influences the detonation process.
