            Hypersonic Propulsion with Detonation Engines</h3>
        
        <h4 id="Abstract" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>

        <p>
            This paper introduces a conceptual design for a high-speed hypersonic aircraft, with a primary focus on the Aurora SR-91, colloquially known as 'the plane that doesn't exist.'
            The aircraft purportedly utilizes a Pulse Wave Detonation engine, renowned for its efficiency in exceeding speeds greater than Mach 5-6. The potential applications of hypersonic flight 
            range from rapid global transportation to enhanced military capabilities, making it a field of intense interest and exploration.
            This paper delves into the specifics of the SR-91's propulsion system, emphasizing its pivotal role in achieving hypersonic flight by examining key factors such as flow behavior and impulse
            and explaining them in terms of the Ideal-Detonation Theory.
        </p>

        <h5 id="Introduction" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>

        <p> Aircraft design is a distinct discipline within aerospace engineering, standing alone amid counterparts like aerodynamics, materials, controls, and propulsion. 
            Traditional engines, predominantly relying on deflagration combustion, encounter limitations when attempting to achieve hypersonic speeds. 
            One major obstacle is the inefficiency of deflagration, where the combustion process occurs at subsonic velocities. 
            This characteristic results in comparatively lower pressure and temperature gradients, making it challenging to propel an aircraft to the extreme speeds.
            Additionally, traditional engines struggle with the management of shockwaves and thermal stresses generated at higher speeds,
            posing significant engineering challenges that can compromise the structural integrity and overall performance of the aircraft. (Zihao, X., 2023)
        
            Therefore, the need for innovative propulsion systems, 
            such as Pulse Wave Detonation Engines, arises to overcome these limitations.
            PWDEs leverage detonation combustion, a more efficient process, to generate higher pressure and temperature gradients,
            enabling aircraft like the Aurora SR-91 to achieve and sustain hypersonic speeds.
        </p>
        
        <h6 id="AnalysisAndDiscussion" style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Pulse Wave Detonation Engine</strong></h6>

        <p>
            A Pulse Wave Detonation Engine is a propulsion technology aiming for efficient and controlled detonation combustion, enhancing engine performance through distinct phases of compression, 
            detonation, and expansion. In the compression phase, shockwave-based compression sets the foundation for the subsequent detonation. During this phase, 
            the fuel and oxidizer mixture undergoes a transition from deflagration to detonation, inducing a shockwave that markedly elevates pressure and temperature. 
            Following the compression, the detonation phase is characterized by a rapid and efficient combustion process, generating a shockwave that significantly intensifies pressure and temperature.
            The concluding expansion phase is pivotal, converting the high-pressure gases into mechanical work. (Debnath, P. 2016)
           </p>

        <p>
            Now, delving into the physics governing PWDE, Newton's third law of motion comes into play. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
            In this context, the expanding combustion wave exerts force on the piston during the action phase, met by an equal and opposite force exerted by the piston on the 
            high-pressure gases during the reaction phase. This reciprocating force propels the piston, converting high-pressure gases into mechanical work. 
            As these gases expand and perform mechanical work, a decrease in pressure ensues, in accordance with the ideal gas law. This expansion results in an increase in volume, 
            liberating kinetic energy that significantly contributes to the overall propulsion of the engine. 
            The culmination of these processes ensures a high thrust-to-weight ratio, a critical factor in sustaining supersonic flight. (Roy, G.D. 2004)
        </p>

        
        <h7 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Ideal-Detonation Theory</strong></h7>
        <p>
            In the Zeldovich–von Neumann–Doering (ZND) model, the reciprocal relationship ρu = constant signifies a dynamic interplay between velocity and density as the detonation wave progresses through the reaction zone. 
            This relationship has profound implications for thrust generation in PWDEs.
            The initiation of a steady ZND detonation involves an incoming unburnt reactant mixture moving at the supersonic shock velocity (D) (Reference1). As this mixture encounters the inviscid shock, 
            pressure undergoes a discontinuous increase to its maximum value, driven by shock compression. Simultaneously, the velocity behind the shock wave transitions from supersonic to subsonic values. 
            The pressure then gradually decreases to its equilibrium state due to flow expansion through the reaction zone, marking the initial phase of the detonation process.
            "The temperature within the combustion chamber experiences a twofold change during this phase. Firstly, there's an immediate increase due to shock compression. 
            Subsequently, as the reaction progresses through the reaction zone, temperature continues to rise owing to the heat release associated with the reaction" (Reference1).
        </p>

        <p>
            For powerful detonations, the ZND structure doesn't limit how fast the detonation wave can move (propagation speed D). This speed (D) can vary based on experimental setups or 
            conditions at the rear of the detonation, as seen in overdriven detonations.
            In overdriven detonations, an external force, often from a piston, pushes the detonation wave to run faster than a critical speed (DCJ) (Reference2).
            The CJ detonation is a special case—it's an unsupported detonation that moves at a specific speed (DCJ) determined by conservation laws (Reference2).
        </p>   

<img src="reaction zone.png" alt="Figure 1.2">
        
        <p>
            Determining the propagation speed (D) for a given piston velocity in a laboratory-fixed frame is crucial. 
            This determination influences the smoothness of the flow behind the detonation, fitting with how the ZND model shows the detonation process. 
        </p>

        <img src="CodeCogsEqn.svg" alt="Figure 1.1">
        <p>
         The increase in subsonic velocity, governed by the ZND model's depiction of the detonation process, translates into a corresponding increase in thrust.
         As the detonation wave progresses, the high-pressure gases expand, and the force exerted on the engine components is amplified. 
         This force, resulting from the reciprocal relationship between velocity and density, propels the aircraft forward, providing the necessary thrust for propulsion.
         In essence, the reciprocal relationship expressed by ρu = constant within the ZND framework directly influences the thrust generated by PWDE</p>

        <h8 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Flow Behavior: Impulse</strong></h8>
        
          <p>
              Now, linking this back to the broader understanding of impulse generation in PWDEs, the sudden increase in pressure, as described in the ZND model, 
              becomes the driving force behind the generation of impulse. 
              "This impulse, a result of the dynamic interplay within the ZND detonation process, transforms into thrust as the high-pressure gases expand" (Reference1).
              The expansion of these gases exerts force on the engine components, propelling the aircraft forward. Thus, the ZND model, with its detailed depiction of the physics underlying detonation, 
              serves as a foundational guide for optimizing PWDEs to harness the generated impulse effectively, ultimately enhancing efficiency and power output.  </p>

        <p>
            Now, linking the sudden increase in pressure described in the Flow Behavior section to the broader understanding of impulse generation in Pulse Wave Detonation Engines 
            creates a seamless transition. As detailed in the Zeldovich model, 
            this abrupt rise in pressure becomes the driving force behind the generation of impulse—a concept crucial to comprehending the dynamic interplay within the ZND detonation process.
        </p>

        <p>
            This impulse, a result of the dynamic interplay within the ZND detonation process, transforms into thrust as the high-pressure gases expand. 
            The expansion of these gases exerts force on the engine components, 
            propelling the aircraft forward. Thus, the ZND model, with its detailed depiction of the physics underlying detonation, 
            serves as a foundational guide for optimizing PWDEs to harness the generated impulse effectively. Understanding the intricacies of impulse generation not only contributes to the efficiency of PWDEs
            but also plays a fundamental role in enhancing overall power output. 
            In essence, the interconnected relationship between flow behavior and impulse generation highlights the synergy that propels PWDEs into the realm of high-speed aviation.
