        <h4 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>

        <p>
            The paper presents a conceptual design for a high-speed hypersonic aircraft, with a primary focus on the Aurora SR-91, often known as 'the plane that doesn't exist'. 
            The foundation of this design is a mission profile, a critical flight outline defined by the US Air Force. </p>

<p>This paper delves into the specifics of the SR-91's mission profile as specified by the Air Force, emphasizing its role in shaping crucial aircraft attributes such as the Propulsion System,
            Wing Planform, and Vertical Configuration. Of particular interest is the propulsion system, 
            a component that significantly impacts aircraft performance. By combining the wing profile and the propulsion system,
            two important parameters, known as wing loading and thrust-to-weight ratio, can be calculated. Unfortunately, 
            this data is not available for the Aurora SR-91, as this is a highly classified aircraft. 
            Therefore, we will explore the speculated propulsion system behind the SR-91, the Pulse Wave Detonation System.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we will investigate how the wing profile affects the performance of an aircraft by examining the SR-91's counterpart, the Lockheed SR-71, also known as the Blackbird.
        </p>
        <h5 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>

        <p> Aircraft design is a unique discipline of aerospace engineering. It stands alone in comparison to its counter parts such as aerodynamics, materials, controls and propulsion.
            <!-- start introduction and link it in with the main topics and start talking about them indivualy, Ideas: in introduction, talk about mission profile, how the SR-91 could fly 
            at an altitude of 135,000 ft. use " to initiate the design process, mission profile is required. mission profile gives a typical mission, 
            which the aircraft requires to perform. mission profile decides the type 
            aircraft and plays a major role in sizing, propulsion system which is going to be used and the design configuration of the aircraft."
            
            Discuss the physics and mathematics behind how the Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE) works and pair it with another topic, 
            you could consider exploring the relationship between the PWDE and its effects on the aerodynamics of the aircraft. 
            This combination provides a comprehensive understanding of how the engine's operation influences the aircraft's flight dynamics. 
            
            Aurora : could fly up to 135,000 ft, cruise at mach 5-6 which is considered hypersonic,
            now link this into first topic and speak about:
            > TOPIC: pulse wave detonation engine, 
            explain how this engine works and how this allows aurora to fly at hypersonic speeds and the physics behind the detonation engine which allows for these speeds
            use images of pulse wave detonation engine to help visualize 
            > TOPIC: wing planform and vertical configuration,
            talk about how the SR-91 has a triangle design helps with effiency, lift, aerodynamics
            potentially show maths or physics behind the aerodynamics. maybe if possible, 
            use matlab to show visuls of the aerodynamics of the triangular shaped design and if results come out successfull, compare them to SR-71
            and show compairson of their wing designs

            >> Brief overview of certain topics:
            
Pulse Wave Detonation Engine:
            
            Describe the operation of the PWDE, including the principles of detonation, compression, and expansion phases.
            Explore the mathematical and physical aspects of the detonation process, including shock wave generation and propagation.

            >Mathematical aspects of the detonation process: 
            
            TOPIC 1: Shock Wave Dynamics and Wave Interaction
            Mathematical models are used to describe the generation, propagation, and interaction of shock waves in the PWDE. 
            These models often involve partial differential equations (PDEs) to account for variables like pressure, temperature, and velocity.
            The Rankine-Hugoniot equations, which are a set of conservation equations, describe the behavior of shock waves, including the jump conditions across the wave.
            Shock waves and detonation waves can interact in complex ways. Mathematical models, such as the ZND (Zel'dovich-von Neumann-Doering) theory,
            provide insights into wave interaction and how it influences the detonation process.

            TOPIC 2: Flow Behavior 
            The mathematical aspects of flow behavior, especially in supersonic or hypersonic conditions, are essential. 
            Flow behavior, in the context of hypersonic speeds, refers to how air or gas flows around and interacts with an object or vehicle traveling at speeds greater than Mach 5
            The flow behavior in a Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE) is highly complex and differs significantly from that in traditional jet engines.
            managing flow behavior is essential when discussing hypersonic speeds because it directly impacts the performance, efficiency, and safety of hypersonic vehicles
            By using the Navier-Stokes equations, engineers and researchers can gain insights into the flow behavior,
            analyze the aerodynamics, optimize the design of hypersonic vehicles,
            and make informed decisions to improve the chances of successful hypersonic flight. 
            These tools are essential for the design and testing of high-speed aircraft.

            Navier-Stokes Equations:
            
            Continuity Equation: 
            The continuity equation ensures that mass is conserved within the flow. It is expressed as:
            ∂ρ/∂t+∇⋅(ρu)=0

            Momentum Equation:
            The momentum equation relates the change in momentum to pressure and viscous forces. It is expressed as:

            ∂(ρu)/∂t+∇⋅(ρuu)=−∇p+∇⋅τ+ρf

            Here, 
            ρ is the fluid density, u is the velocity vector, ∇ is the divergence operator
            p represents pressure, τ is the stress tensor, and f is the body force.

            By solving the Navier-Stokes equations, engineers and researchers can simulate and analyze the flow behavior in a PWDE, 
            which, in turn, aids in optimizing the engine's design and performance. It is worth noting that solving these equations for real-world applications often requires
            the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations due to their complexity. = Can use MATLAB to run these equations.
            
Aerodynamics:
            Examine how changes in engine thrust and the specific impulse affect the aircraft's speed and altitude capabilities.
            Consider how the PWDE's operation may require special considerations in wing design, airfoil selection,
            and control surfaces to maintain stability during different phases of flight. = can link this in with wing planform
            and vertical configuration,(line 161).
