            Hypersonic Propulsion with Detonation Engines</h3>
        
        <h4 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Abstract</strong></h4>

        <p>
            This paper introduces a conceptual design for a high-speed hypersonic aircraft, with a primary focus on the Aurora SR-91, colloquially known as 'the plane that doesn't exist.'
            The aircraft purportedly utilizes a Pulse Wave Detonation engine, renowned for its efficiency in reaching hypersonic speeds. The PWDE operates on the principle of detonation, 
            a significantly more efficient form of combustion compared to the deflagration observed in traditional engines, resulting in higher pressure and temperature gradients.
            This paper delves into the specifics of the SR-91's propulsion system, emphasizing its pivotal role in achieving hypersonic flight by examining key factors such as flow behavior and impulse
            and explaining them in terms of the Ideal-Detonation Theory.
        </p>

        <h5 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>

        <p> Aircraft design is a distinct discipline within aerospace engineering, standing alone amid counterparts like aerodynamics, materials, controls, and propulsion. 
            The Aurora SR-91, with the capability to fly up to 135,000 ft and cruise at Mach 5-6, ventures into the realm of hypersonic flight. 
            To elucidate the Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE), we employ a theoretical model, simplifying the complex principles that underlie its hypersonic capabilities. 
            The Zeldovich-von Neumann-Doering (ZND) ideal-detonation theory provides a valuable and simplified theoretical framework,
            facilitating manageable mathematical analysis and insights into impulse generation, thereby contributing to the understanding of high-speed propulsion systems.
        </p>
        
        <h6 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Pulse Wave Detonation Engine</strong></h6>

        <p>A Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE) is a propulsion technology aiming for efficient and controlled detonation combustion, enhancing engine performance through distinct phases of compression, 
            detonation, and expansion. In the compression phase, the shockwave-based compression sets the stage for subsequent detonation,
            a process where the fuel and oxidizer mixture transitions from deflagration to detonation, generating a shockwave that significantly increases pressure and temperature.
            The expansion phase converts the high-pressure gases into mechanical work, akin to the power stroke in traditional engines. 
            The paper explores the theoretical foundations of PWDEs, emphasizing the ideal-detonation theory's role in understanding rapid and efficient combustion processes characterized by shockwaves.</p>
        
        <p>The unique operational principles of a Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE), with its emphasis on controlled detonation combustion, will be viewed as well from a theoretical point. 
            The ideal-detonation theory often represented by Zeldovich-von Neumann-Doering is a fundamental theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of ideal detonations, 
            which are rapid and efficient combustion processes characterized by shock waves. This theory explains how impulse is generated during the detonation
            phase and how it contributes to propulsion.Understanding this flow behavior is crucial for optimizing engine performance and addressing challenges associated with shockwaves, 
            pressure fluctuations, and heat management.</p>

        
        <h7 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Ideal-Detonation Theory</strong></h7>
        <p>
            The application of the Taylor wave model provides a valuable tool for obtaining accurate pressure estimations within propulsion systems. 
            In the context of detonation engines, this model becomes particularly instrumental in understanding the nuanced dynamics that contribute to efficient propulsion. 
            The Taylor wave model allows us to scrutinize the pressure variations throughout the engine's combustion process, offering insights into the compression, detonation, and expansion phases. 
            It delineates how shockwave-based compression, a distinctive feature of detonation engines, influences the pressure dynamics within the combustion chamber. 
            This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the forces at play, laying the foundation for optimizing the performance of propulsion systems
        </p>
        <p>
            In parallel, the Zeldovich–von Neumann–Doering (ZND) model, integrated into our one-dimensional analytical framework, further unveils the mechanics of steady detonation.
            This theoretical framework allows us to dissect critical factors such as pressure on the detonation tube end and the velocity deficit. 
            Specifically, as we apply the ZND model to the study of a Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE), we can elucidate the unique features of this propulsion system.
            The model enables us to explore how the pressure at the end of the rarefaction wave is crucial for thrust production in the PDE. Furthermore, 
            it helps us understand the velocity deficit phenomenon and its role in the overall impulse generation during the detonation phase. 
            By intertwining insights from the ZND model and the Taylor wave model, we gain a holistic understanding of the underlying physics, 
            providing a theoretical framework that can be translated into the optimization of Pulse Detonation Engines for enhanced efficiency and performance in supersonic and hypersonic flight.

TOPIC 1: Flow Behavior: Impulse 

            >Flow behavior encompases various aspects, we will be looking at
            
            THRUST PULSATIONS: have several important implications for flow behavior 
            and the efficiency of PWDEs for hypersonic speeds:
            
            Thrust pulsations are a key characteristic of PWDEs, and they are an essential aspect of the engine's operation.
            In a PWDE, the detonation process is highly dynamic and occurs in cycles. 
            Each detonation cycle results in a rapid and significant increase in pressure, 
            temperature, and thrust, followed by a period of reduced thrust during the exhaust phase.
            this is known as the High Impulse:
        
            The rapid, high-pressure detonation phase generates a high impulse, 
            providing the engine with substantial thrust in a short duration. 
            
            
            >CFD simulations can show how the thrust output varies during the detonation cycle.
            These thrust pulsations, while challenging to manage, can provide efficient propulsion for hypersonic flight.

            Navier-Stokes Equations:
            
            Continuity Equation: 
            The continuity equation ensures that mass is conserved within the flow. It is expressed as:
            ∂ρ/∂t+∇⋅(ρu)=0

            Momentum Equation:
            The momentum equation relates the change in momentum to pressure and viscous forces. It is expressed as:

            ∂(ρu)/∂t+∇⋅(ρuu)=−∇p+∇⋅τ+ρf

            Here, 
            ρ is the fluid density, u is the velocity vector, ∇ is the divergence operator
            p represents pressure, τ is the stress tensor, and f is the body force.

            By solving the Navier-Stokes equations, engineers and researchers can simulate and analyze the flow behavior in a PWDE, 
            which, in turn, aids in optimizing the engine's design and performance. It is worth noting that solving these equations for real-world applications often requires
            the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations due to their complexity. = Can use MATLAB to run these equations.

           >Representing flow behavior in a Pulse Wave Detonation Engine (PWDE) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Navier-Stokes equations 
             to show how flow behavior affects the ability of a PWDE to reach hypersonic speeds.

TOPIC 2: Shock Wave Dynamics 

            Mathematical models are used to describe the generation, propagation, and interaction of shock waves in the PWDE. 
            These models often involve partial differential equations (PDEs) to account for variables like pressure, temperature, and velocity.
            The Rankine-Hugoniot equations, which are a set of conservation equations, describe the behavior of shock waves, including the jump conditions across the wave.
            Shock waves and detonation waves can interact in complex ways. Mathematical models, such as the ZND (Zel'dovich-von Neumann-Doering) theory,
            provide insights into wave interaction and how it influences the detonation process.
